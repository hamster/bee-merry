# Solder Time

Howdy!  Let's get started on building your ornament.

First step, find and lay out all your parts.

![Parts](images/IMG_20181218_225053.jpg)

You should have:

* Bee Merry PCB
* Santa Hat sticker
* Battery box
* Black strip of LEDs
* White strip of resistors
* A switch
* Two AA batteries

Heat up your iron and flip the PCB over.  I recommend a decent rosin core solder like a Kester 80/20 leaded solder.  You can use lead-free, though you might find it harder to flow the solder.

The copper pads are where we are going to solder things on.  The LEDs go in the wing cutout areas.  **Note the 'All LEDs' mark on the lower left** - this shows which way the LEDs need to go.

Take your iron and put down a decent blob on one pad on all the LEDs.  Tin one of the resistor pads with less solder.  Finally, put a little blob on the 3 pads on the left for the switch.

**Important Note** Pay attention to the orientation mark on the lower left of the board.  Some boards will not have the LEDs the same as what is pictured here.

Now, find your LEDs and remove them from the strip.  Flip them over and find the green triangle on the back.  This triangle needs to face in the same direction as the 'All LEDs' triangle, as shown.

**Important Note** Pay attention to the orientation mark on the lower left of the board.  Some boards will not have the LEDs the same as what is pictured here.

While holding the LED in place, heat the blob of solder and pull the solder up on the LED to join it to the board.  Hold the LED and let it cool.  Solder on all the LEDs this way.  Do the same thing for the resistors, but they don't need to be upside down.

Now take your iron and touch the other side of the LED and the pad at the same time, and feed in some solder.  It should bridge easily.  Remove the iron and let it cool.  Make sure the LED is well soldered - it's OK if it is a little blob-like.

Do the same for the resistor.

Now take the switch and fit the little plastic pegs into the holes in the PCB.  Hold the switch in place with your finger, then take your iron and push on each leg until it sits down in the solder.

Now, find the battery box.  Peel the backing off the double sided tissue tape, and stick to the battery box.  Then peel the other side, and apply firmly to the back of the ornament.  The top of the box should be about 1/4 inch below the two battery terminals at the top.

Now apply a little solder to each of the two terminals on the ornament board above the battery box.  Cut the wires to about an inch long and strip off about 1/8 inch off the ends, or just coil up the wires if you're feeling lazy.  Tin the wires, and then use some tweezers to hold the wire into place and solder across the pad so that it does not stick through to the front.  Red goes to the left (the side with the switch) and black goes to the right.

Find your Santa Hat and remove the backing.  Handle the sticker via the clear transfer tape.  Position it over the hat, and center it up.  Then press it down into place and smooth it out.

Finally, grab the edge of the transfer tape, and carefully pull it off.  This step works best if the Santa Hat is stuck well, and you pull as sideways as possible.

And that's it, you're done!  Install the batteries and turn it on to make sure it's working, and then go hang it up!

If some or all of the LEDs stay red instead of color cycling, make sure the batteries are installed right, that the battery box leads are on the right pads, and that the LEDs themselves are soldered on correctly.  A reverse-polarity LED will not color cycle, but it doesn't hurt it otherwise.
